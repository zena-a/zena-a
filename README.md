## Welcome to my Profile 😎

I'm a tech enthusiast passionate about learning software development, design, and other tech streams. After graduating college with an <strong>Associate's Degree in Computer Science and Information Technology</strong>, I decided to pursue further studies in tech, focusing on Computer Programming and Software Development. I enjoy challenging myself, solving problems in creative ways, and learning new ways to automate tasks. Additionally, I share my learning journey on my tech blog, where I hope to encourage and learn from others.
