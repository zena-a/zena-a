## Welcome to my Profile 😎

I'm from the Commonwealth of Dominica, with an Associate's Degree in Information Technology and Computer Science. I enjoy web development, specifically the frontend stack. I also dabble in web design, graphic design and digital art. Coding has helped me express my self creatively and challenge myself in solving problems and being a continuous learner. I hope to become a digital nomad someday, and mentor others in their coding journey.
